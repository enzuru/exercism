# Exercism

My answers for various [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) questions in Lisp languages.

Considering trying to develop a "universal" Lisp style that I can use across Lisp languages to minimize the context switching penalty.

Experimenting with a universal style that exhibits the following attributes:

- Minimalist (stick to functions that exist in R7RS where possible)
- Functional (imperfect in Emacs Lisp)
- Lexical scope (`;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*-` in Emacs Lisp)
- Modernizations that improve readability (like Clojure's `first` and `rest`)
